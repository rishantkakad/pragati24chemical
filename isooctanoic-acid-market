The global Isooctanoic Acid market was valued at US$ million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2030, at a CAGR of % during the forecast period. 

Isooctanoic Acid(25103-52-0) is a type of fatty acid with nine carbon atoms. It is also called pelargonic acid. Its chemical formula is C9H18O2. Isononanoic acid is obtained by oxidation of isononyl aldehyde. The acid is a mixture of isomers with 3, 5, 5-trimethyl hexanoic acid with weight percentage of about 90. Isononanoic acid is a clear, colorless liquid with faint odor. It is miscible with organic solvents. Isononanoic acid is only sparingly soluble in water. The ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) classifies isononanoic acid as a dangerous material in CPA classifications, as it causes severe eye damage if exposed and causes skin irritation if swallowed. Isononanoic acid is primarily applied as a plasticizer in cosmetics and personal care products. It is used as a skin conditioning agent, cleansing agent, and emulsifying agent in surfactant formulations. It is also used as a herbicide to prevent growth of weeds, both indoors and outdoors, and as a blossom thinner for apple and pear trees. The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the usage of isononanoic acid as a food additive and has added it to the list of synthetic flavoring. With this, it can now be added directly to food.
