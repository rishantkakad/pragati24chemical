The global Cobalt Based Amorphous Metal Ribbons market was valued at US$ 167.7 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 199.2 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 2.5% during the forecast period. 

Amorphous Ribbon is a new soft magnetic material. It is produced through the advanced technology of rapid solidification of molten metal at a cooling rate of about a million ?/sec. During this process the metal is rapidly quenched as a form of ribbon with 25-35 ?m thickness, and the micro-structure of the alloy is the amorphous due to the high quenching rate.
